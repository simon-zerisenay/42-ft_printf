                                                                  ft_printf
ft_printf is a project at 42 that implements the functionality of the C standard library's printf function. printf takes a formatted string and a set of arguments, formats the string according to the specified format, and prints the resulting string to the console. The ft_printf function is implemented in C and uses a series of sub-functions to handle the formatting of different types of arguments.

                                                                Installation
To use ft_printf, clone this repository and compile the library using the make command. This will create the libftprintf.a static library, which you can link to your project using the -L and -lftprintf flags.

                                                            bash
                                                            Copy code
                                                            git clone https://github.com/simon-zerisenay/ft_printf.git
                                                            cd ft_printf
make
Include the header file ft_printf.h in your C program to use the function.

                                                      c
                                                      Copy code
                                                      #include "ft_printf.h"
                                                              Usage
The ft_printf function has the following prototype:

c
Copy code
int ft_printf(const char *format, ...);
The format argument is a string that specifies the desired format for the output. The format string can contain placeholders, indicated by the % symbol, which are replaced by the corresponding arguments.

For example, the following code snippet will print the string "Hello, world!" to the console:

c
Copy code
#include "ft_printf.h"

int main() {
    ft_printf("Hello, world!\n");
    return 0;
}
Format Specifiers
ft_printf supports a wide range of format specifiers, which are used to format different types of input arguments. The following table provides a summary of the supported format specifiers:

Specifier	Type	Description
%c	char	Character
%s	char*	String
%p	void*	Pointer address
%d, %i	int	Decimal integer
%o	unsigned int	Octal integer
%u	unsigned int	Unsigned decimal integer
%x, %X	unsigned int	Hexadecimal integer
%f	double	Floating-point decimal
The format specifiers can be modified by adding optional flags, which control the formatting of the output. For example, the following code snippet will print the integer 42 with a width of 10 characters and left-justified alignment:

                                                                c
                                                                Copy code
                                                                ft_printf("%-10d", 42);
                                                                Flags
ft_printf supports the following optional flags, which can be added to the format specifiers to modify the output:

                                                                Flag	Description
                                                                -	Left-justified alignment
                                                                +	Always display a sign (+ or -)
                                                                0	Zero-padding
(space)	If no sign is displayed, display a space
                                                                    #	Alternate form
For example, the following code snippet will print the integer 42 with a width of 10 characters, zero-padding, and right-justified alignment:

                                                              c
                                                              Copy code
                                                              ft_printf("%010d", 42);
                                                              Precision
ft_printf also supports precision, which can be used to specify the number of digits to display after the decimal point (for floating-point numbers) or the minimum number of digits to display (for integers). The precision is specified using the . character followed by a number.

For example, the following code snippet will print the floating-point number 3.14159265 with a precision of 2 digits after the decimal point:

                                                            c
                                                            Copy code
                                                            ft_printf("%.2
